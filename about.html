<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I'm Shahzeen, a beginner web developer currently learning the fundamentals of HTML.</p>
<p> This portfolio is one of my first projects, created as part of my web development course. Iâ€™m passionate about building websites and excited to explore more about front-end and back-end development.</p>

<p>This portfolio marks the beginning of my journey in web development. As I continue learning, I look forward to improving my skills and adding more features with CSS and JavaScript. Stay tuned for updates as I grow in this field!</p>
